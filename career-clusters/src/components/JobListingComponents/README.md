# This folder would be where any potential code for an integration with GrowthZone would go.  

## In a similar fashion to the Cluster and SubCluster style components, a "Job" component could go here, where information such as a job title or company could be pulled across and put in a component to display on a page here.  

### JobListingPage.js and JobListingPage.css are here as placeholders, but they do not have to be used.  They are not tied into anything currently.  

### On the SubFieldsPage.js, one could change the link for the View Job Postings button to navigate to this page instead.
